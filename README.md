<h2 align="center">Airline Passenger Demand Forecasting Project</h2> 

This project encompasses a Python application that predicts airline passenger demand using regression models and artificial neural network methods. The project includes steps for data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

<h3 align="left">Technologies and Libraries Used</h3>
Python: The project is written in the Python programming language.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas: Employed for data analysis and processing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
scikit-learn (sklearn): Utilized as a library providing machine learning algorithms and tools.
MLPRegressor (Artificial Neural Network Regression Model): Used to create artificial neural network-based regression models.

<h3 align="left">Usage</h3>
The project can be initiated by running the main component file, HavayoluYolcuTahmini.py. This file loads the dataset, trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the results.

<h3 align="left">Project Stages</h3>
Data Loading: The dataset is read from the HavayoluYolcu.csv file.
Data Preprocessing: Dependent and independent variables are separated. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Data normalization is performed.
Model Training: Various regression models and an artificial neural network model are trained.
Performance Evaluation: The prediction performance of each model is evaluated, and metrics are calculated.
Results Visualization: The relationship between predictions and actual values is visualized through graphs.

<h3 align="left">Model Performance</h3>
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R2 Score

<h3 align="left">Results</h3>
The project evaluates the proximity of predictions to actual data and the performance of the models. Additionally, graphs depicting the predictions of regression models are created.
