<h2 align="center">Machine Learning Methods Detection of Breast Cancer</h2> 

This project is a classification using machine learning algorithms. Based on breast cancer data, the value of a dependent variable is predicted and classified by a model. The project includes data analysis, model training and performance evaluation. The results obtained are successful compared to similar studies.

<h3 align="left">Technologies and Libraries Used</h3>
Python: The project is written in the Python programming language.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and data manipulation.
Pandas: Employed for data analysis and processing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
scikit-learn (sklearn): Utilized as a library providing machine learning algorithms and tools.
MLPRegressor (Artificial Neural Network Regression Model): Used to create artificial neural network-based regression models.

<h3 align="left">Usage</h3>
The project can be started by running the main component file called microcalcification.py. This file loads the dataset, trains the model, makes predictions and evaluates the results.

<h3 align="left">Project Stages</h3>
Data Loading: The dataset is read from the file Microcalcification.csv.
Data Preprocessing: Dependent and independent variables are separated. The dataset is split into training and test sets. Data normalization is performed.
Model Training: Various regression models and a neural network model are trained.
Performance Evaluation: The prediction performance of each model is evaluated and metrics are calculated.
Visualization of Results: The relationship between the classified values and the actual values is visualized through graphs.

<h3 align="left">Model Performance</h3>
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:

How close to the true value in the data set
The percentage of successful classification
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R2 Score

<h3 align="left">Results</h3>
The project evaluates the closeness of the predictions to real data and the performance of the models. It also generates graphs showing the results obtained using the classification algorithms.
